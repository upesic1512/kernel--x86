# kernel--x86
This is a small but completely functional kernel that supports multithreading with time-sharing. This kernel has its own thread management system, creating and running threads, as well as fully functional semaphores and interrupt events concept.

Kernel is made as user program. Concurrent processes in the kernel are just lightweight processes (threads). Application and kernel are compiled and linked in the same program.

For demonstrational purposes, the application is best to be executed within any 32 bit Windows operating system.
